            <p>We believe that potential is evenly distributed across Indian society, but opportunity is not. <br>
                Masai is democratising education with a unique Pay After Placement (PAP) Model. <br>
                PAP allows you to study the course of your choice at <span>₹0 upfront fee. <br></span></p>

                                require any collaterals. If you do not get placed within 1 year of course completion,
